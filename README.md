📌 Project Overview:
This data analytics project analyzes pizza sales data to gain insights into business performance and understand key trends. By utilizing SQL for data extraction and Tableau for visualization, the project identifies critical metrics such as sales volume, customer preferences, and peak operational hours.

❓ Problem Statement
The goal of this project is to analyze key indicators for pizza sales data to derive actionable insights. The analysis focuses on the following specific requirements:

To assess overall business performance, the dashboard tracks five primary Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) derived from the sales data. These metrics include Total Revenue and Total Orders to measure financial volume, Average Order Value and Average Pizzas Per Order to understand spending habits, and Total Pizzas Sold to track overall inventory movement.

Dynamic visuals were developed to evaluate distinct sales trends, including stacked bar and line charts that identify peak activity hours and weekly fluctuations throughout the year. The dashboard also features pie charts for analyzing sales distribution by category and size, alongside bar and funnel charts that rank the top and bottom 5 performing pizzas based on revenue and quantity metrics.

🛠️ Tools Used
•	Database: Postgre SQL Server (v19.0)
•	Visualization: Tableau (v2025.3.0)
•	Data Cleaning/Analysis: MS Excel (Version 2021)

📊 Key Insights: 
Peak activity during lunch (12:00–1:00 PM) and dinner (4:00–7:00 PM), with the "Classic" category driving the highest overall sales volume. While The Thai Chicken Pizza generates the most revenue and The Classic Deluxe Pizza leads in total quantities sold , The Brie Carre Pizza consistently underperforms, recording the lowest figures for revenue, quantity, and total orders.
